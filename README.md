## Hi there, I'm Rishabh Yadav 👋  

🚀 *About Me*  
I’m a *DeFi Smart Contract Engineer* with *4+ years of experience* building, upgrading, and securing lending & borrowing protocols across Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.  
Core contributor to *Venus Protocol, working on liquidations, flash loans, governance upgrades, and multi-chain deployments. I focus on **protocol solvency, risk management, gas efficiency, and secure upgradeability*, turning complex DeFi logic into production-ready infrastructure.
